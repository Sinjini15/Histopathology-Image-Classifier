# Results Summary ðŸ“ˆ

This project fine-tuned a pretrained ResNet-18 model on histopathology image patches (PatchCamelyon dataset) to classify tumor vs normal tissue.  
The pipeline was built to demonstrate end-to-end deep learning design, including data handling from .h5 files, model fine-tuning, structured training and evaluation, GradCAM interpretability, and production readiness for real-world biomedical AI tasks.
