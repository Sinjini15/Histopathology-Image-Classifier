# Histopathology Image Classifier ðŸ§¬ðŸ©º

This project builds a deep learning pipeline to classify histopathology image patches as tumor or normal tissue using a fine-tuned pretrained CNN (ResNet-18).  
The goal is to create an end-to-end, production-ready ML solution for biomedical imaging tasks.

## Project Structure ðŸ“‚

- `src/dataset.py`: Loads and preprocesses the PatchCamelyon dataset (.h5 format).
- `src/model.py`: Loads and adapts a pretrained ResNet-18 model.
- `src/utils/train_utils.py`: Training and evaluation loop utilities.
- `src/utils/gradcam_utils.py`: GradCAM utility for model interpretability.
- `src/utils/eval_utils.py`: Metrics calculation, ROC curve and confusion matrix plotting.
- `src/train.py`: Training orchestration script.
- `src/gradcam_runner.py`: GradCAM visualization script.
- `src/eval_runner.py`: Evaluation metrics generation script.
- `models/`: Saved best model checkpoint.
- `outputs/`: Folder to save GradCAM heatmaps, ROC curves, and confusion matrix.

## Dataset ðŸ“Š

- **Dataset**: [PatchCamelyon (PCam)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/metastatic-tissue-classification-patchcamelyon)
- **Format**: `.h5` files (separate for images and labels for train, validation, and test splits)
- **Task**: Binary classification (Tumor vs Normal)

## How to Run ðŸš€

### 1. Install requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download the data from Kaggle

From the Kaggle link mentioned previously, you can either download the .zip file or you can also run the following script
```
import kagglehub

# Download latest version
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("andrewmvd/metastatic-tissue-classification-patchcamelyon")

print("Path to dataset files:", path)
```
This saves the data to a root directory which will print to the terminal after the dataset is downloaded. Use this for determining ```ROOT_PATH_X``` and ```ROOT_PATH_Y``` in ```path_utils.py```.

### 3. Train the model

```
python src/train.py
```

### 4. Generate GradCAM visualizations

```
python src/gradcam_runner.py
```

### 5. Generate evaluation metrics (ROC curve, Confusion matrix)

```
python src/eval_runner.py
```
